# A Yul book with examples
I decided to do a deep dive into Yul to sharpen my skills with the low level coding. In this git repo I've collected and structured all the information i've learned about EVM memory types, their features + Yul.
During my education I mentioned, that information about Yul structured not in the best way on Google resources, and newcommers into Yul might have problems with learning. So my proposition is to keep everything in one place - in this repo.

## How does this repo work
1. I have folders structured in a hierarchical order from basic topics to more advanced.
2. In each folder there will be a README.md file with all information, details and examples related to the topic.
