# A Yul book with examples
I decided to do a deep dive into Yul to sharpen my skills with the low level coding. In this git repo I've collected and structured all the information I've learned about EVM memory types, their features + Yul.

## Potential problem this repo might solve:
During my learning process I mentioned that information about Yul is not structured in the best way on the internet. To have a full picture of what is low level coding in Ethereum at the moment you should collect pieces of information from different blogs, articles, YouTube videos. I was faced with the situation that most of the authors on the internet do posts/articles on 1-2 topics about Yul they've learned. This is not a wrong approach for knowledge sharing, but newcomers into Yul might have problems with learning when they start to learn about calldata without previous experience with storage, memory. So this repository might be a solution for people who are starting their journey with Yul low level coding. 

## How does this repo work
1. I did a hierarchical order from basic topics to more advanced.
2. In each folder there will be a README.md file with all information, details and examples related to the topic.
